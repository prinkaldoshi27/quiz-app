   - The UI adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.

### 7. **Dynamic Question Navigation**
   - Users can navigate between questions using a stepper component.
   - The app ensures that users cannot skip questions without answering, maintaining the integrity of the quiz.

### 8. **Keyword Highlights**

## How It Works

### 1. **Starting the Quiz**
   - When the app loads, users are presented with the first question.
   - The timer starts immediately, and users must select an answer before the time runs out.

### 2. **Answering Questions**
   - Users can select one or more answers (depending on the question type).
   - After selecting an answer, the app provides instant feedback:
     - If the answer is correct, the selected option turns green.
     - If the answer is incorrect, the selected option turns red, and the correct answer is highlighted in green.

### 3. **Navigating Between Questions**
   - Users can move to the next question using the "Next" button or the stepper component.
   - The app ensures that users cannot proceed without answering the current question.

### 4. **Completing the Quiz**
   - After answering all questions, the app navigates to the result page.
   - The result page displays the user's total score and a summary of their performance.
